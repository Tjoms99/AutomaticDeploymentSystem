# AutomaticDeploymentSystem
The Automatic Deployment System is a low powered system that controls a winch used for gathering plankton. It consists of four systems: 
  1. The Underwater Sensor System (USS)
  2. The Drum Relay System (DRS)
  3. The Winch Control System (WCS)
  4. The App that controls USS, DRS and WCS

The Underwater Sensor System's job is to gather underwater data such as pressure and temperature, acting as a CTD, and as the achorpoint for a plankton net. 
The Drum Relay System's job is to transfer, or relay information between the USS and the WCS.
The Winch Control System's job is to use information recieved from the USS to automatically control a winch such that the wanted depth of the plankton net is reached.
